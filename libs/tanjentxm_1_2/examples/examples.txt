In this folder lies example projects to help you get started using the
TanjentXM library!

HaXe
=======================================================================
This example is a complete project. It is meant to be used with
FlashDevelop. It should work on Flash, Windows and Android target.

The compiled .swf file is about 58 kB with about 3-4 minutes of audio.

To use TanjentXM with this project copy the "tanjent" folder from the
"tanjentxm_1_2\haxe_openfl\src\" to the "XMPlayer\src" folder. Your
complete folder structure should look like this when ready to compile:

... tanjentxm_1_2\examples\haxe\XMPlayer\src\my\example\Main.hx
... tanjentxm_1_2\examples\haxe\XMPlayer\src\tanjent\tanjentxm\FixedPoint.hx
... tanjentxm_1_2\examples\haxe\XMPlayer\src\tanjent\tanjentxm\Player.hx
... tanjentxm_1_2\examples\haxe\XMPlayer\src\tanjent\tanjentxm\ ...
... tanjentxm_1_2\examples\haxe\XMPlayer\src\tanjent\tanjentxm\XMSample.Hx

The dynamic audio generation on the current OpenFl/Lime (2.0.1) has a
real bad bug - but it can be fixed, please read the readme.txt!
Also make sure to check the OpenFL Forums or the OpenFL GitHub
repository for the latest update on the Android OpenAL implementation.

Java
=======================================================================
Due to libgdx projects being rather large I've only included a typical
main class "TanjentXMExample.java" with some example code on how to
setup, play and dispose the tanjentxm library. The base project is
the standard project produced by the new and improved gdx-setup.jar

To use TanjentXM with Java/libgdx in a "real" project you will need
to place some .xm files in the android assets folder (copy these from
the HaXe example project's assets folder). Also you will need to
reference/copy the TanjentXM java files from src/java_libgdx/*.* to
the "com" root of the core libgdx project (as similar to the HaXe
version). The final location of the added tanjentxm files should
be something like this (in a project named ExampleProject):

... ExampleProject/core/src/com/tanjent/tanjentxm/FixedPoint.java
... ExampleProject/core/src/com/tanjent/tanjentxm/Player.java
... ExampleProject/core/src/com/tanjent/tanjentxm/ ...
... ExampleProject/core/src/com/tanjent/tanjentxm/XMSample.java

Also, don't forget to refresh your project if you use Eclipse
whenever you put something new in the android assets folder
(Default key F5).

Enjoy!
